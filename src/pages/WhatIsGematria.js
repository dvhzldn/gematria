				Simple Gematria is a form of numerology in which each letter of the
				alphabet is assigned a specific numerical value. The simplest form
				of Gematria assigns a number to each letter in sequence, with A = 1,
				B = 2, C = 3, and so on until Z = 26.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Simple Gematria, the value of a word or phrase is calculated by
				adding together the numerical values of each letter in the word. For
				example, the word "HELLO" is calculated as follows:
			</p>
			<p class="gematria-line">
				<span>H</span> = <span>8</span>
				<span>E</span> = <span>5</span>
				<span>L</span> = <span>12</span>
				<span>L</span> = <span>12</span>
				<span>O</span> = <span>15</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				The total value of "HELLO" in Simple Gematria would be 8 + 5 + 12 +
				12 + 15 = 52.
			</p>
			<p>
				Simple Gematria is often used for spiritual and philosophical
				purposes, and it can be a way to explore deeper meanings within
				words, names, and phrases.
			</p>
			<p>
				This system is one of the most widely known and used methods of
				Gematria, which has been a part of ancient mysticism and various
				cultures.
